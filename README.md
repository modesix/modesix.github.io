# Autonomous Mode of Production

## The Beginning: 1883 

During one small portion of the ongoing Industrial Revolution, Marx developed the "Modes of Production" based on his own unique observations, analysis, and writings -- his nature -- and the nurturing of contemporary academic, economic, political, and social life. 

A very keen mind, constantly sparring with the Young Hegelians and sharpened by Engels, Marx was nurtured well in life, seeing widespread adoption of his ideas. By focusing on real, measureable phenomena, his ideas pierced the veil of idealist fantasy, resonated with applicants of his theories, and sparked lasting social and academic waves still rippling through all spheres of real life today. 

Marx's ideas have had as much impact as the class, labor, and socioeconomic divisions he analyzed. However, by leaving the expression of the Communist (and "transitionary" Socialist) Modes of Production up to totally unknown successors -- essentially leaving behind two blank cheques to anyone who could write well enough to match his handwriting -- Marx's well was poisoned through by Stalin and Lenin. 

Today, the authoritarian excess of United Russia under Putin shadows the worst atrocities of the Bolshevik Party, with a healthy dose of "Foundations of Geopolitics". Maoism, another one-party intepretation of Marx, keeps it's stranglehold on Chinese culture and politics. 

We are here today to retrace the five "giant leaps" Marx took for Mankind -- Tribal, Neolithic, Antique/Asiatic, Fuedal, and Capitalist. 

We will be here tomorrow to take our first "small step" in another direction -- away from the existential crisis of Capitalistic and State-Communist Modes of Production. 

This is where we break with Marx and his greatest heirs, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao. 

The literature on Modes of Production has hardly been updated since 1883. Empty -- literally, blank pages -- theories of Socialism or Communism are of no value, nor are one-party, authoritarian interpretations. 

True, there are other interpretations of Marxism. Some recalled learning to walk before they ran, actualizing the Socialist Mode of Production as best they could. Successful Libertarian Socialist movements in Chiapas, Mexico owe much to Che Guevera, a Marxist. Rojava, Kurdistan survives, organized by Democratic Confederalism, itself nurtured by Ocelan during the PKK's insurrectionary struggle for a Kurdish Communist territory. 

However, they are not the idealogical lineage of this author. To an all-American anarchist, the value of Marx's theories come from his technique of dialectical analysis. 

Dialectical analysis, as opposed to the Hegelian emphasis on individual interpretation, can draw collectively-sourced and mutually agreeable conclusions, and from there, direct action. 

Techniques of dialectical analysis must be updated for the twenty-first centurty, and rigorously applied and tested in the real-world pursuit of life, liberty, and happiness; or as Hannah Arendt would want, a plurality of freedom in labor, work, and action; or as this author would put it, the realization of the Autonomous Mode of Production.

## The Sixth Mode: Autonomy 

Autonomists view the Sixth Mode of production as an ideal, a limit that can never quite be reached. 

In an idealogical battle against Capitalism and One-Party Communism, Autonomy finds allies in Socialism, Mutualism, Federalism, Indigenous People's Movements, and Libertarian Communism. 

Autonomous metrics -- the answers we give to dialectical questions -- will draw, as much as possible, from insight about the fates of autonomous/anarchist experiments like the Ukrainian Free Territories, Revolutionary Catalonia, and Rojava Kurdistan.

## Breadth of Idealogical Lineage 

Our primary support -- meaning the references that actually agree with this work, which should be in the minority to assure a full stress-test, will come from Anti-Authoritarian, Anarchist, Libertarian-Communist, Kurdish Democratic-Confederalist, & American Federalist schools of thought. 

We will examine Imperialist, Colonial, One-Party Communist, Authoritarian, Totalitarian, and Fascist regimes to understand their strengths and weaknesses as we would any threat. 

We will rely on current and historical real-world data to analyze our measures. The key question is, what data to track? That essential question will be explored after we chart our idealogical assumptions and axioms. 

We will synthesize points of unity from various libratory territories and authors to understand the core set of metrics to track when considering a culture's health and capacity. 

## Social Kinetics

What is the functional use of a school of autonomous thought? It is to expand Marx's rational, material dialectical analysis beyond class, labor, and socioeconomic relations. 

These metrics have been unable to inspire an alternative to Capitalism -- the mode of production that currently dominates the planet, and structurally underpins it's bespoke foes in most nominally Socialist or Communist countries. 

Decyphering how these modes actually function, by material metrics that can be catalogued equally for all, is the first step in actualizing an alternative that can truly meet the needs of all people. 

Fundamentally, Autonomists aim to defend an idealist goal by imperfect material means. The fundamental constant of change means that, even if Autonomy does become a viable mode of production for a significant cross-sectional portion of the solar system's life, it will eventually have to give way to another mode of production. Perhaps this could be the ideal Communism Marx dreamed of. 

Besides the unreacheable limit of true Autonomy, Autonomists also accept that they will almost certainly always compete with other modes, inc. both Capitalism and whatever eventually takes its place. Predicting that successor will be key to the long-term survival of autonomy.
